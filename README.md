As social media becomes a bigger part of our lives, the media from where we choose to consume becomes more important. Meta recently launched a social media app despite the already crowded social media market. This projects analyzes a dataset of reviews on Meta's new Threads app and serves to answer the question: 

> *Does the Threads app possess signs of longetivity in the oligopoly of social media apps?*

In doing so it dives into related sub questions such as:
> *What do people commonly think about the app?*

> *What are the similarities and differences between a 5 star and 1 star review?*
